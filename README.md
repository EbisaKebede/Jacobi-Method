# Jacobi-Method
This class provides a simple implementation of the Jacobi method for solving  * systems of linear equations. */  /*   How to use:   The program reads an augmented matrix from standard input,   for example:      3    5 -2  3 -1   -3  9  1  2    2 -1 -7  3    The number in the first line is the number of equations   and number of variables. You can put this values in a file   and then execute the program as follows:    $ java Jacobi &lt; equations.txt    If the matrix isn't diagonally dominant the program tries   to convert it(if possible) by rearranging the rows. */
